# ReBind

Ability to disable, remap and hide any controls (including Esc, F1, F3, F4). Esc, F1, F3, F4 will be added to "Misc" section after modification installation. This mod is clientside.

Use config.json (open with Notepad++ for example) to manage controls (open jar with any archiver and go to /assets/rebind/config/). This file allows you to set default key codes for any key, remove it from controls and even fully disable key. File contains tips.
